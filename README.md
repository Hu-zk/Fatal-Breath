###  Fatal Breath is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend Development:** <br> The Fatal Breath app is built using [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter enables the development of cross-platform mobile applications with a single codebase, allowing them to run seamlessly on various devices, including mobile, desktop, and web.

- **Backend Development:** <br> For the backend, [Laravel](https://laravel.com) is used. Laravel is a robust PHP framework known for its elegant syntax and powerful features, making it ideal for building efficient and secure server-side applications.

- **Database Management:** <br> The application relies on MySQL for database management. MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system that ensures data is stored and retrieved efficiently.

- **Real-time Chat:** <br> To facilitate real-time communication among users, Firebase Realtime Database is integrated. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is a Google-backed platform that offers real-time database capabilities, making it perfect for features like live chatting within the app.

- **Notifications:** <br> Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is used for sending push notifications to users. FCM is a cross-platform messaging solution that ensures reliable message delivery across different devices.

- **Advertising Website:** <br> The advertising website for the Fatal Breath app is developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a popular React framework for building fast and SEO-friendly web applications. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is used to enhance the website's development, providing static typing and better tooling support.

- **User Interface:** <br> The app's user interface adheres to a responsive and modern design using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that simplifies the styling process while maintaining a highly customizable design.

- **Hardware Integration:** <br> Fatal Breath includes hardware integration with an [ESP8266 microchip](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266) connected to an MQ2 sensor. This setup enables the monitoring of CO levels within rooms and provides real-time data to the app.

- **Font:** <br> The primary font used in the app is ["Poppins"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins), known for its readability and versatility.

<br><br>

<!-- Prototyping -->
<img src="./readme/titles/title3.svg" name="prototyping"/>

> We designed Fatal Breath using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.
